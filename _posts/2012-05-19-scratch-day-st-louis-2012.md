[Scratch Day](http://day.scratch.mit.edu) is an annual celebration for kids who love the [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) programming environment. This year it took place on Saturday, May 19 2012. 

My daughter is a huge fan of the software, so we decided to host an event here in St. Louis. 

We were incredibly fortunate to be able to use the facilities at [St. Louis BWorks](http://www.bworks.org/). They have a 6-week Earn-a-computer program where they teach kids about computers and then let the kids bring a system home. 

I can't say enough good things about BWorks' volunteers, their excellent facilities or the great work they do in the community. We were able to use a room with a projector and a dozen PCs running Ubuntu. 

The kids decorated before the event:

[Warrior Cats](http://www.warriorcats.com/warriorshell.html) have a huge fan base on Scratch:

Aaron Jackson, a volunteer at ByteWorks, started the proceedings:

We had a good turnout for our first event, every PC was in use:

Anais (my daughter), a 5th grader giving an introduction to Scratch basics:

Alex, a 5th grader, put on a programming clinic and showed us how to find if a letter is in a a word and how to create a calculator.

One of our goals was to have the attendees share their projects with the group:

People getting hit in the face with a soccer ball was a recurring theme:

Overall, the kids had a great time and left wondering when they could celebrate Scratch Day again. [There are a few more event pictures on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/59467518@N00/sets/72157629803580696/).
